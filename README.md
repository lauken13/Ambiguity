Code for the Cognitive Science 2017 submission (data available upon request)

This repo contains 4 files:

CleanData.R takes the raw data and cleans it up based upon some criteria (participants couldn't do it more than once etc.)
OrdinalTestFunction.R is the Bayesian model we coded to test an ordinal (increasing) relationship across conditions
AnalyseData.R Need to source OrdinalTestFunction first. Contains all of the analyses we reported.
CreateFigures.R is the code to create the figures seen in the plot (lighter boxes and images of the conditions added post hoc)

At this stage the commenting is relatively low so any questions please email.
